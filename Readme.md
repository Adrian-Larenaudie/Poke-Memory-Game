### Simple project to make me practice vanilla JavaScript.

**Memory card game with pokemons pictures.**  

**Principle of the game**  
If two last card turned over are the same they are visible otherwise if not hidden again.    
The goal is to succeed in turning over all the cards.  

I wanted to make it harder to do by adding some features:  
- like the real game every card are shuffled before you start playing, so I randomly took 6 pics from a pokemon image database and then I've put on the grid each selected cards randomly
- A simple scoring system, 2 points if cards are match or -1 points if they don't
- I just added for fun a game loading page simulation with little animations

In future I wanted to add:
- several possibilities of larger grids with more cards
- more animations
- improve visual rendering
